> DrupalGap has two parts...

1. [Drupal Module](https://drupal.org/project/drupalgap)
2. [Application Development Kit](https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap)

> How does the module work?

- uses [Drupal 8 REST](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/rest) and [JSON](http://www.json.org/) to open communication between the app and the website

> How does the application development kit work?

- uses an optional [CSS Framework](Introduction/CSS_Frameworks) (*of your choice*) to style the app's user interface
- optionally uses [PhoneGap (Cordova)](/Introduction/PhoneGap_and_Cordova) to compile the app for release on Android and iOS devices (*plus many others*)
