Ionic Drupal Demo - Backend
===========================

This is a demo showing how you might integrate Drupal 8 and the Ionic Framework to build a very simple mobile app.

This is the back end of the application, which is a [Drupal 8](http://drupal.org/project/drupal) site.  It is a stock Drupal site, although the code is at an unstable version (6f78b08dea).

To get started with this application, clone the project down, install the Drupal site, and set your staging config directory in settings.php to sites/default/config.  Then run a configuration import to enact the necessary configuration to serve the app.

This backend is currently set up for demo purposes at http://talltails.lastcallmedia.com, and you can use this for testing.  No guarantees about how long it will say up though...
